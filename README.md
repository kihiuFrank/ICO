# ICO
An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent of an initial public offering (IPO). A company seeking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service can launch an ICO as a way to raise funds.

Interested investors can buy into an initial coin offering to receive a new cryptocurrency token issued by the company. This token may have some utility related to the product or service that the company is offering or represent a stake in the company or project.
## The ICO spin on crowdfunding
The concept of initial coin offerings is similar to crowdfunding. A team comes up with an idea for a cryptocurrency-related project. Then they need to get enough money to develop their idea. Instead of (or alongside) trying to court investment from a venture capital fund (as most traditional start-ups do), these teams publicly announce their idea and allow almost anyone to invest.

During an ICO, it is possible to buy coins of the new cryptocurrency at a predetermined price. This is the first time anyone can buy the new currency. The idea is that the price of the coins will increase as time passes and the investors, or backers, will profit from that.

However, the coins don’t exist yet or are distributed in a locked-down state, so the backers can’t use them immediately. The coins only become usable after the development process is over. In case the ICO fails to gather enough funds, the new cryptocurrency is usually not created (or completed) at all and backers get their money returned to them.

The details of an ICO are normally specified in a whitepaper, a document that outlines the idea and the plans of the developers. The whitepaper can contain everything from the type and the amount of funds necessary to complete the project, and the technical details on what their product strives to achieve, to the conditions under which the funds can be returned if the ICO fails.

## The stages of an ICO
ICOs have several stages, not all of which are fully open to the public.

An ICO begins with a private sale. This usually takes place behind closed doors, a few months before the ICO is open to the public. During this stage, the team tries to collect money to be spent for marketing and funding the next stages of the ICO. Since the project is not yet on its feet and many things have to be handled manually, they try to avoid a multitude of small investors and usually create an investment threshold (say, 1000 USD).

The next stage is the presale. By this stage, the funding process has been somewhat automated and manual work reduced. The ICO is now open to the public, but investing is still not available to everyone. The team makes a selection, usually based on know-your-customer filters, or even a random selection, in order to prevent overcrowding. The presale itself can be split into multiple phases. The price of the coins increases with every phase.

After that, it is finally time for the crowdsale. During the crowdsale, investors may need to be whitelisted and can be required to submit a KYC form. This is necessary to comply with regulations (such as anti-money-laundering policies and anti-terrorist prevention measures).
